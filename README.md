# 1. Create a Github Account
Get a Github Account

2. Go to https://github.com/ and create an account with your username, email and password

# 2. Build a Personal Website
This is your personal website at <your_username>.github.io

### Step One: Create Your First Repository
1. On the homepage of Github, click "new repository"
2. Create this new repository by using "<your_username>.github.io" as the name of your repository. My username is msyinmei so I named my user site repository "msyinmei.github.io"
3. Decide if you are creating a *public* or a *private* repository
4. Select " Initialize this repository with a README "
5. Click " Create Repository "

### Step Two: Make Your First Commit
1. You can follow the directions on the official Github page on [how to make your first commit](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change). 

OR

1. Go to the repo that you built
2. Click on " *Clone or Download* "
3. Select "Use HTTPS"
4. Copy the text to the clipboard by using the clipboard icon.
5. In your terminal, navigate to "Documents" directory. 
6. Type the command `ls` to check what files you have in your Documents directory.
7. Type in the command `git clone ` and paste the text you clipped earlier. 
You should have:`git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_username>.github.io.git` by replacing <your_username> with your own username. 
8. Type the command `ls` again in your terminal, and you should have cloned your own directory! 
9. Change directories into the  "<your_username>.github.io" directory with the command `cd <your_username>.github.io` 
10. Make a file called index.html with the command `touch index.html`
11. In this file, type `<h1>Hello World <h1>`
12. Save the file, then back in your terminal type the following: (https://try.github.io/)
  
  ```sh
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m"this is my first commit" 
  git push origin master
  ```
13. When prompted for your password, type it in.
Now, open up your website to "<your_username>.github.io" 
Congratulations! You have a website!
